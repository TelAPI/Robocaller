RoboCaller
==========

What is it?
-----------

This is a sample, pluggable application for <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">, using <a href="http://www.telapi.com">TelAPI</a> for automated
dialing ("robo calling") and playing a MP3 file for the recipient.  It can also play a text-to-speech message.


How to Install
--------------

### As A Standalone ###


To run as a standalone Django project, you can use '''django-admin.py''' to create a poject.  You will also need to run '''pip install -r requirements.txt''' to install required packages.

In your project's '''settings.py''', add

> INSTALLED_APPS += ('csvdialier',)

Modify the '''local_settings.py''' and set the following parts to appropriate values:

> ACCOUNT_SID = u'ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
> ACCOUNT_TOKEN = u'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
>
> CALLBACK_BASE_URL = u'http://www.example.com'

The CALLBACK_BASE_URL should be set to base URL for the publicly-accessible web host you will be running on.

SID and TOKEN values can be generated by creating a <a href="http://www.telapi.com">TelAPI</a> account.

Restart your django server.

### As Part of an Existing Project ###


Clone the git repository inside the PYTHONPATH of your project (inside the root directory of your project will work).

Add '''csvdialer''' to your project's settings.py

Add the following to your project's '''settings.py''' file:

> ACCOUNT_SID = u'ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
> ACCOUNT_TOKEN = u'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
>
> CALLBACK_BASE_URL = u'http://www.example.com'

The CALLBACK_BASE_URL should be set to base URL for the publicly-accessible web host you will be running on.

SID and TOKEN values can be generated by creating a <a href="http://www.telapi.com">TelAPI</a> account.

Restart your Django server.
